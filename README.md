**Title:**
**Tech as Utility: Unveiling the Structural Stability of Nasdaq-100 via Propaganda-Adjusted Volatility (PAV)**
*(科技即基建：透過宣傳調整後波動率揭示那斯達克100的結構性穩定)*

**Abstract:**

The prevailing financial axiom equates "High Volatility" with "High Risk." This paper challenges that paradigm within the context of the post-2014 Technology Supercycle. We hypothesize that the observed excess volatility of large-cap technology stocks (proxied by **QQQ**) is largely attributable to "Attention Noise"—quantifiable market sentiment rather than fundamental solvency risk.

We introduce a non-parametric filter, the **FOMO Discount Factor ($D_t$)**, derived entirely from market-endogenous signals: the ratio of the CBOE S&P 500 Volatility Index (**VIX**) to the CBOE Nasdaq-100 Volatility Index (**VXN**).

$$ D_t = \frac{VIX_t}{VXN_t} $$

By applying this factor to the realized volatility of the Nasdaq-100, we isolate the asset's **Structural Volatility ($\sigma_{struct}$)**:

$$ \sigma_{struct} = \sigma_{realized} \times D_t $$

**Empirical Evidence (2014–2025):**
Our analysis reveals a structural convergence: the risk profile of the "Propaganda-Adjusted" Nasdaq-100 consistently aligns with, and often underscores, the volatility profile of the Utilities sector (**XLU**). This suggests that modern Tech Giants (MCS - Mental Consumer Staples) have fundamentally transitioned from "Growth Speculation" to "Digital Infrastructure," possessing utility-like stability masked by media-induced noise.

**Key Contribution:**
This protocol provides a mathematical framework to decouple "Fear of Missing Out" (Greed/Panic) from "Business Risk," offering a new lens for risk parity and asset allocation in the AI era.
